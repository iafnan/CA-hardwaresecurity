# ES2 - Hardware Security
Emulation of hardware trojan attack model in microprocessor core and mitigation of triggering mechanism using evolutionary algorithm based scheme.
```
- First phase:
The goal of first phase is to introduce hardware trojan in a RISC based microprocessor soft core implementation on verliog based hardware description.

- Second Phase:
Whereas in the second stage, it is required to find and implement a mitigation scheme using evolutionary algorithm.
